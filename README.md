This project is a conversational AI system designed to understand and utilize context during conversations.  
Unlike standard chatbots that only react to the latest message, this agent retrieves and reasons over relevant background data â€” such as past user inputs, documents, or knowledge bases â€” to deliver more coherent, accurate, and personalized responses.  

The project demonstrates how **context retrieval** and **context-aware generation** can be integrated into a dialogue system powered by large language models (LLMs).
