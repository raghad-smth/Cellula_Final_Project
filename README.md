💬 Project Name: A Context-Aware Conversational Agent
---


### 📖 Overview
This project is a conversational AI system designed to understand and utilize context during conversations.  
Unlike standard chatbots that only react to the latest message, this agent retrieves and reasons over relevant background data — such as past user inputs, documents, or knowledge bases — to deliver more coherent, accurate, and personalized responses.  

The project demonstrates how **context retrieval** and **context-aware generation** can be integrated into a dialogue system powered by large language models (LLMs).
